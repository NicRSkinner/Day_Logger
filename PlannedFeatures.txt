PURPOSE OF THIS FILE: This file is for storing a list of features that I plan on getting working.

- Auto-populate Start Time TextBox with the end time of the last item in the DataGrid.
- Recalculate the duration field in the DataGrid when either the start time or the end time has been changed.
  - Duration cannot be changed directly.
- Reset status, call type, customer type, and reference number boxes when a new stamp is added.
- Add logging for debug purposes.
- Add real-time debugging.
- Integrate ChangeHandler into main program for undo/redo functionality.
- The name of the window should change to "Day Logger*" (added *) when the file has been edited.
- Organize the time stamp fields to be in a more "vertical" orientation, split onto 2 lines.
- Add ability to change configuration settings within the application.
  - Allow user to create profiles for different configurations.
- Add button to make a custom status/call type/customer type for the next timestamp.
  - Reset the custom box when a timestamp is added.
- Add ability to duplicate a selected punch (Button?)
- Window name should be the name of the file that the user is editing. (Ex. "Day Logger - 01/01/2000")
